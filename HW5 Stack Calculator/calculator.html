<h1>Calculator</h1>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>In this assignment you'll create a simple calculator that can read expressions
from a String and produce a result.  The calculator will use a syntax referred to
as "Reverse Polish Notation" (RPN) or "Postfix", which has historically been common
among scientific calculators like those created by HP.</p>
<h2>Set up</h2>
<p>Begin by launching Eclipse/IntelliJ and starting a new Java project for your work.
Download the assignment <em>zip</em> and extract it.  You
should see two files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Calculator.java</code></li>
<li><code>CalculatorTests.java</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Calculator Design</h2>
<p>The calculator is based on a stack. It works as follows:</p>
<p>(1) when a number is entered, push it onto a stack.
(2) when an operator is entered, pop the appropriate number of
    arguments off the stack, perform the operation, and push the result
    back onto the stack
(3) when no more numbers or operators are left to process, pop the
    top value off the stack. This is the 'answer'.</p>
<p>We will use String expressions to interact with the calculator. A
valid String consists of 1 or more numbers and 0 or more operators
that are separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs).  Collectively, we'll
refer to numbers or operators as "tokens".  For example, the String "4
2 +" contains two numbers: 4, and 2; and one operator "+".  Thus,
there are three tokens.  Evaluating the String should begin a process
that reads in each token and takes an action based on the token's type
(either number or operator). For the String above, this process should
unfold as follows: (1) push the value 4 onto the stack; (2) push the
value 2 onto the stack; (3) pop two values off the stack, compute 4 +
2 and push the result, 6, onto the stack.  Then (4) since the
expression is fully processed (i.e., there are no more tokens are left
to process), we should pop the top element off the stack, here it is
6, and return that value as the answer.</p>
<h2>Implementing the Calculator</h2>
<p>The <code>Calculator.java</code> file contains a partially implemented
class.  Your job is to complete it.</p>
<p>To get you started, the skeleton code contains method signatures for
all of the methods that you must implement. Look through the code, and consider:</p>
<p>1) <em>what instance variables</em> will you need to support your work? Hint, use an array of
<code>double</code> values for your stack.</p>
<p>2) <em>how</em> will you process the string expression? Here, you'll likely want to make use of the
<code>Scanner</code> class that we used earlier. A <code>Scanner</code> instance can be created by passing a
String as an argument to the <code>Scanner</code> constructor. The <code>Scanner</code> then has several valuable methods
that let us process the String and extract tokens from it.  Specifically, the following methods
will be useful to you: (1) <code>hasNext()</code> returns true iff there is another token in the input (here the
input is a String); (2) <code>hasNextDouble()</code> returns true iff the next
token can be turned into a double (i.e., the next token is a valid number);
(3) <code>next()</code> retrieve the next token as a String; (4) <code>nextDouble()</code> return the
next token and attempt to turn it into a double.  Note
that if the next token is actually "cheese" and you call <code>nextDouble()</code> the Scanner will attempt to turn the
token "cheese" into a number and fail, throwing an exception.</p>
<h2>Example Expressions</h2>
<p>See the provided <code>main()</code> for examples.</p>
<p>Autolab will not test for the thrown exceptions. This will come from the TA points.</p>
<h2>Turning it in</h2>
<p>Turn in the final version of your <code>Calculator.java</code> file via Autolab.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<ul>
<li>30 Points will be ascribed to Autolab testing</li>
<li>10 Points will be given for style</li>
</ul>
